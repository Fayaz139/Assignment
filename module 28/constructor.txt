1. What is a Constructor?  
A constructor is a special method in Java that initializes an object. It has the same name as the class and no return type. It is invoked automatically when an object is created.  

2. What is Constructor Chaining?  
Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another within the same class using `this()` or from a superclass constructor using `super()`. It helps in code reuse.  

3. Can we call a subclass constructor from a superclass constructor?  
No, a superclass constructor cannot directly call a subclass constructor. The superclass constructor executes first, and the subclass constructor is invoked afterward.  

4. What happens if you keep a return type for a constructor?  
If a return type is added to a constructor, it becomes a regular method and is not treated as a constructor, leading to improper object initialization.  

5. What is No-arg constructor?  
A no-arg constructor is a constructor that takes no parameters. It initializes an object with default values.  
Example: `class Example { Example() { System.out.println("No-arg constructor called"); } }`  

6. How is a No-argument constructor different from the Default Constructor?  
A default constructor is automatically provided by Java if no constructor is defined, while a no-argument constructor is explicitly written by the programmer.  
Example: `class DefaultConstructor { DefaultConstructor() { System.out.println("No-argument constructor"); } }`  

7. When do we need Constructor Overloading?  
Constructor overloading is needed when different ways of initializing an object are required. It allows multiple constructors with different parameters.  
Example: `class OverloadExample { int x; OverloadExample() { x = 0; } OverloadExample(int value) { x = value; } }`  

8. What is Default Constructor? Explain with an Example.  
A default constructor is a constructor that is automatically provided by Java when no constructor is explicitly defined. It initializes objects with default values.  
Example:  
`class DefaultExample { int x; DefaultExample() { x = 10; } void display() { System.out.println("Value: " + x); } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { DefaultExample obj = new DefaultExample(); obj.display(); } }`
